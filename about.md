# Traveling Fish

In this document we will try to specify our mission statement. I will try to be as detailed as possible because it is important to understand what we want to achieve and how.
### About The Name

**OK WE HAVE TO THINK OF A NEW NAME**

Fish is something which reminds me of Blue Whales (I do not eat fish so definitely not food :D). Whales are the species which not only travels earth horizontally but also vertically. It travels far and deep, charting down the uncharted territory. It always fascinated me if we can somehow see from their eyes the path they travels to and things they see. At this point I have to declare that I never saw with my own eyes an actual whale fish, yes through tele of course. 

But, however modern and tech savvy we become, the curiosity and adventure that we get in seeing things with our own two eyes will beat the technological advancements now and in future. We human are nothing but blue whales of land we travel horizontally and vertically as far as we can go and as long as we can live.

This actually let me to derive the name we the **Traveling Fish** of land :).

We need to build a comprehensive and user friendly product to encourage users to go out of their busy work life and plan for the fun and exciting vacations. Travel around the world and share about new uncharted tourist destinations. Let us empower each of the user to create and promote what they think is a cool place to visit and see. 

Let the other users to see and explore the places discovered by fellow traveling fishes. Empower the users to promote and help small and poor vendors whom they met on their last trip. Let the users posses the power to benefit poor vendors and help them in becoming economically strong by providing free promotion via this platform.
