# Traveling Fish

In this document we will try to specify our mission satement. I will try to be as detailed as possible because it is important to understand what we want to achive and how.

### About The Name

Fish is something which reminds me of Blue Whales (I do not eat fish so definately not food :D). Whales are the species which not only travels earth horizontly but also verticaly. It travels far and deep, charting down the uncharted teritory. It always fasinated me if we can somehow see from their eyes the path they travels to and things they see. At this point I have to declare that I never saw with my own eyes an actual whale fish, yes through tele ofcourse. 

But, however morden and tech savy we become, the curiosity and advanture that we get in seeing things with our own two eyes will beat the technological advancements now and in future. We human are nothing but blue whales of land we travel horizontly and verticly as far as we can go and as long as we can live.

This actually let me to derive the name we the **Traveling Fish** of land :).

### What it is about

Purpose of his applicaion is to let people plan, organize, and then share about their journies. We need to build a comprihensive and user friendly product to encourge users to go out of their busy worklife and plan for the fun and exciting vacations. Travel around the world and share about new uncharted tourist destinations. Let us empower each of the user to create and promot what they think is a cool place to visit and see. 

Let the other users to see and explore the places descovered by fellow traveling fishes. Empower the users to promot and help small and poor vendors whom they met on their last trip. Let the users posses the power to benifit poor vendors and help them in becoming economically strong by providing free promotion via this platform. 

Encourage people to come out of their offices and see the world by themselves. Encourage them to be envvironment concious by means of traveling. Provide them with a tool to help poor but talented vendors whom they met on a remote highway or next to some village by sharing their location and about them.
