# Traveling Fish

In this document we will try to specify our mission satement. I will try to be as detailed as possible because it is important to understand what we want to achive and how.

### About The Name

Fish is something which reminds me of Blue Whales (I do not eat fish so definately not food :D). Whales are the species which not only travels earth horizontly but also verticaly. It travels far and deep, charting down the uncharted teritory. It always fasinated me if we can somehow see from their eyes the path they travels to and things they see. At this point I have to declare that I never saw with my own eyes an actual whale fish, yes through tele ofcourse. 

But, however morden and tech savy we become, the curiosity and advanture that we get in seeing things with our own two eyes will beat the technological advancements now and in future. We human are nothing but blue whales of land we travel horizontly and verticly as far as we can go and as long as we can live.

This actually let me to derive the name we the **Traveling Fish** of land :).
